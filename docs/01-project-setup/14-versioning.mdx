(We need to add the image from Confluence about the versioning here)
Following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible hox fixes.

This repository uses [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automatically release versions following the rules defined above and the following [configuration](./../.releaserc).
