## Naming convention

The default for files and folders is `camelCase`

Exceptions:

- React Components: folder and files as `PascalCase`.
- Next.js pages: it's the router, so whatever make sense for the project.
- Docs: folders and files as `kebab-case`

## File Structure

Files or folders created in the first and second level described above should be discussed and approved by the team.
