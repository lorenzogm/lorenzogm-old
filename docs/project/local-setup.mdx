## Local environment

The only requirement is Node.js v14

There are different ways to install it:

- Download it from [their website](https://nodejs.org/)
- Use [nvm, Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Use [asdf, another version manager](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf), in this case it's not just for Node.

It's recommended to use a version manager, so the Node version can be easily changed. Then, asdf is just better than nvm because you can also manager other software with it.

## Install

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/lorenzogm/lorenzogm

Install dependencies:

    npm install
