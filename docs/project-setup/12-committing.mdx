In addition of the previous quality checks, there is one more check which would prevent you to commit your code: the commit message.

The commit message is analysed by `commitlint` and it should follow a specific format defined by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

To get some help in this process, this repository includes `commitizen`. Just open your terminal (terminal FTW!) and run:

    nom run cz

## Conventional Commits

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missin- semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp- broccoli, npm)
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle- BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- revert: Reverts a previous commit
