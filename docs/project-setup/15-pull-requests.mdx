The pull requests will be merged into the main branch via `squash and merge`, providing a linear and clean history of commits for the repository. This is as well connected to the automatic [versioning](./14-versioning.md).

> **Therefore, it's very important to have the right title in the Pull Request**

The title must follow the Conventional Commits described in the [committing](./12-committing.md) section, with two additions:

- The ticket number before the title
- The Pull Request number

So, the final format should be like this one:

    type(scope): [LGM-123456] title of the ticket (#XY)

Which is compose with the following elements:

- Type: "feat", "fix" are the most common, the full list is in the [committing](./12-committing.md) section.
- Scope: described in the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Ticket number: [LGM-XXXXXX]
- Title of the ticket
- (#YY) Reference to the PR in GitHub (It will be added automatically before finishing the squash merge).

To get some help in this process, this repository includes a [Pull Request Linter](../../.github/workflows/pull-request-linter.yml). This GitHub workflow adds an additional check to verify the Pull Request title.
